As of 9/20/24, I currently attend a high school in Northern Indiana and was working on the units, in which I graduate high school in 2027.

I am 15 years old with mental health issues, being constantly annoyed gets me upset pretty quickly.
Then it came to me, I don't want to be constantly annoyed every class period but also I want to help people with their units.

So, thus I formed the CodeHS community.
So far I have only Unit 1 inserted.

Here's some disclaimers:

a. All code inserted was copy-pasted from the original, so there is a possibility that any information could be detected as plagarism.
b. All units with the code was also inserted from the last modification date, so there is a potential that an error may arise.
c. I am not liable for any errors caused, unless a security vulnerability may potentially be present.
d. This place is open-source, as I am a huge fan of the linux community in which the systems are typically open-source in question.
e. Teachers, students, parents, or newcomers can use the software.
f. I do not provide warranties, again if you don't know GNU/Apache's licensing.. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE WARRANTIES, I DO NOT PROVIDE ANY!
g. Ignore any created units that appear on the page, I'll replace it when I have the chance to do so with the correct title.
h. This should be utilized as a last-resort option, and this place is not for cheating. You literally cannot cheat, because the code that
  orginates here will come from Github as the official writer which is a coding service and then CodeHS is also a coding service so basically
  plugging a flash-drive into a power brick.
i. There should be no account required to copy the code, however you can contact me if there is anything wrong including those.
